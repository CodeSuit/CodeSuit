<h1>I cried for you all nights, and I am still crying for you.</h1>
<br>
<h3>
The rain hammered down, a relentless rhythm that matched the beat of my heart. I sat by the window, watching the drops race down the glass, each one a tear I couldn’t hold back. You were never mine, and with you went the light in my life. The silence around me was deafening, punctuated only by the echoes of your laughter that still haunted my mind.
<br>
<br>
You never knew how deeply I felt for you. We were friends, close enough that your presence was a constant in my life. Every shared laugh, every secret whispered in confidence, only deepened my affection. But I kept my love hidden, afraid of ruining what we had, afraid of your rejection.
<br>
<br>
I remember the way you used to look at me, your eyes filled with warmth, but never with the kind of love I hoped for. You spoke of your dreams, your future, never knowing that in my dreams, you were always by my side. I was there when you fell in love with others, my heart breaking each time I saw you happy with someone else.
<br>
<br>
Every place we visited together feels like a shrine to you. The bench still holding the imprint of where you used to sit. I go there often, clutching the scarf you always wore, its scent fading but never forgotten. I hold it close, hoping to feel your presence, if only for a moment.
<br>
<br>
Days have turned into weeks, and weeks into months, yet the pain is as fresh as that fateful day. Friends tell me it will get easier, that time will heal the wounds. But they don’t understand. They don’t know what it’s like to love someone so deeply, yet never have that love returned. The nights are the hardest, when the world is asleep, and I am left alone with my thoughts. I close my eyes and see your face, hear your voice whispering promises we never got to keep.
<br>
<br>
I cried for you then, and I cry for you still. The tears flow freely, a testament to the love that time could not diminish. I write you letters you will never read, speak words into the void, hoping somehow you can hear me. I tell you about my day, the little things that made me think of you. I ask for your guidance, your wisdom, your comfort.
<br>
<br>
Some say I should move on, but how can I? You were not just a chapter in my life; you were the entire book. Without you, the story feels incomplete. I carry you in my heart, a part of me that can never be replaced. And so, I cry, not because you are gone, but because you were here, and you were loved more than words can ever express.
<br>
<br>
I cried for you, and I still cry for your love, because in those tears, I find a piece of you that remains with me, forever.
<br>
<br>
